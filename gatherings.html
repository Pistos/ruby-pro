	<h3 id="rules">What is a Gathering?</h3>
	<p>
		A gathering is like a meeting in IRC where predefined topics will be discussed.
		For each topic one or more members will act as a host, which means they will have
		op and also can decide how channel moderation is utilized.<br />
		An example for what a gathering could be about is "pimp my code" where everbody
		brings pieces of abysmal to excellent code and channel members will compete to
		come up with the nicest solutions (ruby-quiz turbo so to speak).<br />
		Another example could be a user who demoes his newest library, framework or app.
		Possibly with some guide through the code and remarks why he solved things the way
		he did.<br />
		Yet another could be a user who demonstrates how to use a tool, e.g. git, netbeans or
		any other tool people might use in their development chain.
