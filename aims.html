<div class="block">
	<h3 id="aims">Aims</h3>
	<p>With #ruby-pro I want to:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Provide a place for undisturbed discussion of advanced ruby topics</li>
		<li>Create a channel where people new to ruby can learn by observing</li>
		<li>Establish a network of people who can aid ruby, its libs and documentation</li>
		<li>Have an active and interactive source of news</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>
		In order to fulfill the first aim, the channel is moderated (+m flag is set, only
		users with voice - that's the +v flag - set can talk) permanently. This disables
		possible <a href="">help vampires</a> to degrade the quality of the channel.
	</p>
	<p>
		But people with experience talking about a topic are a great resource for less
		experienced users. Simply by reading conversations and see how solutions to
		problems are formed and implemented in code can help to learn new patterns or
		even be inspiring. For this reason the channel is still public.
	</p>
	<p>
		Most often you will find that those with the most experience also suffer the
		most under flaws in a language, a library or a framework. Given the available
		expertise it would be incredible to leverage that knowledge and improve ruby
		where possible. For one alone such a task can be too much, but with the
		support of a whole channel full of experts backing one up, it becomes a lot
		easier.
	</p>
	<p>
		An idea that has to prove itself first is to frequently hold
		<a href="gatherings.html">gatherings</a>. This can act as a multiplier in
		spreading knowledge and greatly help to have fun coding and using the right
		tools in the best way.
