	<p>
		All of the following rules are experimental and subject to change.<br />
		Also be aware that these rules are mere guides. They don't imply any guarantees.<br />
		In all mentionings of votes, it is implied that only users with voice have a counting
		vote.

	<dl>
		<dt>Gaining voice</dt>
		<dd>
			To gain voice you need at least one person how vouches for you.
			Should it indeed happen that somebody is against you gaining voice in
			#ruby-pro, then you will need a 2:1 majority of people who vouche for
			you versus people who are against you gaining voice.
		</dd>
		<dt>Losing voice</dt>
		<dd>
			If you want that somebody loses voice, you have to get a 2:1 majority
			in a vote.
			An alternative way of losing voice is acting against the channel-policy,
			such as the use of ad-hominem attacks.
		</dd>
		<dt>Kicks and Bans</dt>
		<dd>
			You can be kicked if an argument gets out of hand and becomes personal.
			This is meant to help the involved parties to cool off before any bridges
			caught fire and get burnt.
			Use of ad-hominem attacks will result in a 24-120h ban.
