	<p>
		#ruby-pro is a bit a special channel. It is there for the experienced ruby users
		to have a disturbance-free zone to talk about advance ruby topics. It also serves
		for newbies or just less experienced rubyistas to read and learn.
	</p>
	<p>
		Another feature of #ruby-pro are the occasional gatherings where even normally
		unvoiced users can host a topic.<br />
		Gatherings are a great way to improve your knowledge and skill in a short time.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you feel ready for participating, there are various ways to gain voice status
		which is required to talk in #ruby-pro. For one if you hosted a gathering-topic,
		you will get voice. If you stand out in #ruby-lang, helping others it is also likely
		that you get invited. And the last way to get voice is by another voiced user
		vouching for you.
